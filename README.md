A website linking html/css, java, and mysql

The brief was to create a website which would take data from a mysql database and display it in a browser via Tomcat and Java servlets.

I have removed the connection information because it linked to the university server, which obviously can't be accessed by the public.

Features implemented are (refer to assignment brief):

Task 1 (40%-50%): 1) 2) 3) 4) 5)

Task 2 (50%-60%): 1) 2) 3) 4) 5) 6)

Task 3 (60%-70%): 1) 2)

Task 4 (70%-80%)

Login system (customer only)
Those not logged in can access the searches but not buy anything.
Registration screen and details stored in suitable database tables.
Customers have a unique customer number.
Customers can check their previous orders.

Other tasks (80%+)

Use of DAO (for the login system).
Listings can be ordered by price or title or artist etc.
Customers cannot buy albums where stock count is zero.

Not implemented: Task 4 (70%-80%)

Admin users can get details of all current orders.
Admin can amend stock database by deleting/adding albums.
